    # Adapts a ReactiveStreamStore into an Enumerator, so a *push*-based
    # reactive store can be driven by *pull*-based code that consumes it with
    # `#each`, `#next`, `#take`, or any other Enumerable method.
    #
    # The bridge only *observes* the store; it does not open or tear down the
    # connection. The caller owns the store's lifecycle. The bridge subscribes,
    # yields the store's current and subsequent values, and unsubscribes when
    # iteration ends — however it ends (exhaustion, error, `break`, or abort).
    # It does not reset the store; that is the caller's decision.
    #
    # This is the store-backed counterpart to AsyncIterable.from_publisher.
    # That helper turns a raw DataPublisher into an Enumerator and queues every
    # message so none are dropped. `bridge_store_to_async_iterable` instead sits
    # on top of a ReactiveStreamStore, so it reflects the store's
    # loading/loaded/error/retrying lifecycle — and, because a store only ever
    # holds the *latest* snapshot, it is latest-wins rather than fully buffered.
    #
    # On iteration it seeds from the store's current snapshot, then yields its
    # lifecycle:
    # - 'loaded'   → yields the value (the one already present when iteration
    #                begins, then each subsequent update), unless the optional
    #                +should_yield+ predicate rejects it. Latest-wins: if several
    #                notifications land between pulls, only the most recent
    #                unconsumed value is yielded.
    # - 'error'    → raises, so the consuming loop propagates it. Substitutes a
    #                SolanaError::SUBSCRIBABLE__STREAM_CLOSED_WITHOUT_ERROR
    #                sentinel when the store reports an error with a nil payload.
    #                An error takes precedence over a buffered value: if a loaded
    #                value is still pending when an error arrives, that value is
    #                dropped and the error propagates.
    # - 'loading' / 'retrying' → carry no new value and no error; nothing to yield.
    #
    # +signal+ follows the same convention as the rest of Subscribable: a lambda
    # called to test for abort, which *raises* once aborted. When it raises,
    # iteration ends cleanly (no error) — an abort is teardown, so the store's
    # incidental abort-driven error state is not surfaced. Because a Ruby
    # consumer parks in a blocking wait rather than on an event loop, the signal
    # is re-tested every +poll_interval+ seconds while parked; it is checked
    # immediately on every store change regardless. With no +signal+, the
    # enumerator parks indefinitely between values — a subscription never
    # completes on its own, so `break` out of the loop to stop.
    #
    # @param store [ReactiveStreamStore] a store to observe. Connect it yourself.
    # @param signal [Proc, nil] raises once aborted; ends iteration cleanly.
    # @param should_yield [Proc, nil] gate run against each loaded value before
    #   it is yielded. Return false to drop the value.
    # @param poll_interval [Float] seconds between signal re-tests while parked.
    # @return [Enumerator]
    #

    #     publisher, data_channel: :slotNotification, error_channel: :error
