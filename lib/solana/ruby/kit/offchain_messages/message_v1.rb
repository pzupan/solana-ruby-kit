    # A signer (a wallet, say) returns the message bytes it signed alongside its signature.
    # Verifying that signature proves only that the signer produced it over *those* bytes;
    # it says nothing about whether those bytes represent the message that was asked for.
    # Use this to establish that they do, then verify the signature separately.
    #
    # Perform this assertion *before* verifying signatures. A signer that signed the wrong
    # message would otherwise surface as a signature verification failure, misattributing
    # the problem to the cryptography rather than to the content.

    # Required signatories are compared without regard to order — both lists are sorted
    # first, and reported sorted so they can be compared by eye. Order is the only thing
    # ignored: the lists are otherwise compared element by element, so listing an address
    # twice on one side and once on the other is a mismatch rather than a no-op.
