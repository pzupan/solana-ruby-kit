    # Creates a TransactionPlanExecutor — a callable that traverses a TransactionPlan,
    # executing each single transaction message and collecting results.
    #
    # Configuration:
    #   execute_transaction_message: ->(context, message) { context_to_report }
    #     Called once per SingleTransactionPlan with a fresh, mutable +context+ Hash and
    #     the transaction message to execute. Store data on +context+ as execution
    #     progresses, and return the context a successful result should carry. The two
    #     serve different outcomes: what you *store* reaches a failed or canceled result,
    #     what you *return* reaches a successful one. On success the returned Hash is
    #     merged over the stored one, the returned value winning, so anything recorded
    #     but left out of the return value is still reported.
    #
    #     Raise a SolanaError to signal failure; remaining plans will be canceled. The
    #     context accumulated up to the point of failure is preserved on the resulting
    #     failed result, which is useful for debugging or building recovery plans.
    #
    #     A one-argument callable is still accepted for backwards compatibility with the
    #     shape this method used to require — `->(message) { { transaction:, context: } }`
    #     — and is adapted onto the context flow above.
    #
    # The returned executor is a lambda: executor.call(transaction_plan) -> TransactionPlanResult
    #
    # Mirrors `createTransactionPlanExecutor(config)` from @solana/instruction-plans.
    # NOTE: Ruby translation is synchronous; abort-signal support is omitted.

    # Creates a TransactionPlanExecutor that processes every leaf concurrently.
    #
    # It takes the same configuration as +create_transaction_plan_executor+ and its
    # +execute_transaction_message+ callback follows the same contract: it receives a fresh
    # mutable +context+ Hash for every leaf and returns the Hash a successful result should
    # carry. On success the two are merged with the returned value winning; when the callback
    # raises, the context accumulated so far is preserved on the failed result. The legacy
    # one-argument callable shape is accepted here too.
    #
    # The difference is the traversal. This executor preserves the input plan's nesting, order
    # and divisibility in the returned result, but it does not enforce the execution
    # dependencies expressed by sequential plans: every leaf is started immediately, each on
    # its own thread, with no concurrency limit. That makes it suitable for work that can be
    # performed independently, such as signing or serializing transactions. For the same
    # reason a callback that raises does not cancel the other leaves — each one runs to
    # completion — and non-divisible sequential plans are supported rather than rejected.
    #
    # Once every leaf has settled, a result tree containing any failure raises
    # INSTRUCTION_PLANS__FAILED_TO_EXECUTE_TRANSACTION_PLAN carrying the complete tree on its
    # +transaction_plan_result+ reader.
    #
    # Because each leaf runs on its own thread, the callback must be safe to run concurrently
    # with itself. Each leaf gets its own context Hash, so the contexts do not need guarding,
    # but anything the callback shares between invocations does.
    #
    # Mirrors `createTransactionPlanExecutorWithConcurrentLeaves(config)` from
    # @solana/instruction-plans.
    # NOTE: Ruby translation has no abort signal; leaves are never canceled, only failed.
